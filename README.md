DevramaMVC
============

'DevramaMVC' is a light weight MVC structured router.
It can be easily extended from this simeple structure.
Additionaly, it does not start session until the user login. The session will be available only after user logs in.
Session control is pretty heavy comparing to other server job since the data comes either form files or databases.
